Considerations:
-Employees are only allowed to participate once a day.
-An employee can give either a like or a dislike to a comment but not both. 
-On some companies, they are allow to reply to comments of their peers.
-We don't have demographics on Happyforce: so no hiring date or turnover date is available on the dataset. Only account deletion date is available.
