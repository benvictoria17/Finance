A CLO vehicle is formed by raising various classes or tranches of debt (with the most senior tranches being rated AAA to the most junior tranches typically being rated BB) and equity. The CLO vehicles which the company intends to focus on will be collateralized primarily by Senior Loans, and will generally have very little or no exposure to real estate, mortgage loans or to pools of consumer-based debt, such as credit card receivables or auto loans.
